    "The goal of this method is to estimate the causal effect of a predictor variable $X$ on a target variable $Y$ if the effect from $X$ to $Y$ is confounded. The idea of the instrumental variable approach is to account for this confounding by considering an additional variable $I$ called an instrument. Although there exist numerous extensions, here, we focus on the classical case. We provide two definitions.\n",
